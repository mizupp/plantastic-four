# House Your Plant?

:seedling::leaves::cactus::herb::ear_of_rice:

House Your Plant? is a website that allows users to track their house plants. Users can add the house plants they own in real life to a virtual shelf where they are able to see information about their plant and track its watering schedule.

Users are also able to upload a photo of your plant and our ML will tell them if their plant is healthy or not.

This repo contains the frontend files for the website.

## Challenges and Wins

### Challenges :no_entry

Problem - Trying to pass variables and data across different components become complex as the app grew.

Solution - Used Redux which has unidirectional data flow to store states and change them by sneding an action.

### Wins :trophy:

ML
VR
